A major challenge towards practically useful quantum computing is characterizing and reducing the various errors that accumulate during an algorithm running on large-scale processors.

Here we develop cycle benchmarking, a rigorous and practically scalable protocol for characterizing local and global errors across multi-qubit quantum processors. We experimentally demonstrate its practicality by quantifying such errors in non-entangling and entangling operations on an ion-trap quantum computer with up to 10 qubits, and total process fidelities for multi-qubit entangling gates ranging from 99.6(1)% for 2 qubits to 86(2)% for 10 qubits.

Trapped atomic ions are one of the most promising physical quantum computing architectures and have been the focus of our research at the University of Innsbruck.\nWithin QCosmo, we aim to explore the physics and harness the computational potential of a more complex trapped ion system: polyatomic molecules. As a first task, we tackle the long standing challenge of preparing, controlling and characterizing single polyatomic molecules at the quantum level using techniques that have been developed for quantum computing with atomic ions.\nQuantum logic with trapped molecular ions Performing spectroscopy on molecular ions has a long history. Unfortunately, most experimental methods destroy the molecules in order to detect their state. Within this project we will use logic methods that have been invented to enable spectroscopy on inaccessible atomic ions that cannot be read-out with existing methods. These quantum logic methods couple the ion of interest to an atomic ion that is suitable for quantum computing and quantum control techniques have already been developed. Quantum logic powers one of today\u0026rsquo;s most precise atomic clocks.\nThe core concept of quantum logic spectroscopy is based on the coupling of the spectroscopy ion\u0026rsquo;s motion to the logic ion\u0026rsquo;s motion via the strong electromagnetic interaction. This coupling allows us to transfer the techniques that have been developed for quantum computing, onto less accessible species. Lately, these techniques have been transferred to molecular ions at PTB, NIST, and the University of Basel. To date, these quantum logic methods have been limited to diatomic molecules and to precision spectroscopy at the micro- to millisecond timescale. We aim to transfer these techniques to ulatrafast timescales and to complex polyatomic molecules, opening a new window into investigating dynamic processes of molecular ions that are not well studied yet.\nCharacterizing ultrafast processes Internal processes in molecules occur often at ultrafast picosecond and femtosecond timescales, which makes them hard to access by standard spectroscopic techniques. To overcome this problem, ultrafast time domain spectroscopy has been invented which uses a series of laser pulses at the femtosecond timescale to gain information about molecular processes. We plan to transfer these processes to trapped ion systems by exploiting the fact that each photon absorption event comes with a small kick to molecule. We will exploit a single photon absorption detection technique by measuring the recoil of absorbing a single photon using the co-trapped atomic ion. This technique is independent of the molecular species and the transition type and will thus provide a solid basis of the following experiments. The recoil from absorbing a molecule is instant and thus the experimentally accessible timescale is given by the lasers that interrogate the molecules.\nMore details on the proposed method can be found in the publication Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy with single molecular ions\n","date":1596052019,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596052019,"objectID":"21123bc2ca401b14d48597afc21f3eaf","permalink":"/project/qcosmo/","publishdate":"2020-07-29T21:46:59+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/qcosmo/","section":"project","summary":"Quantum characterization and control of single molecules","tags":[],"title":"QCosmo","type":"project"},{"authors":[" P.

Our strategy is based on analytically integrating out the gauge bosons, which preserves exact gauge invariance but results in complicated long-range interactions between the matter fields. Trapped-ion platforms are naturally suited to implementing these interactions, allowing for an efficient quantum simulation of the model, with a number of gate operations that scales only polynomially with system size. Employing numerical simulations, we illustrate that relevant phenomena can be observed in larger experimental systems, using as an example the production of particle--antiparticle pairs after a quantum quench. We investigate theoretically the robustness of the scheme towards generic error sources, and show that near-future experiments can reach regimes where finite-size effects are insignificant. We also discuss the challenges in quantum simulating the continuum limit of the theory.

Here we report the first experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and efficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related.
